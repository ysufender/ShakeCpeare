# ShakeCpeare

Ever got tired of the compact and symbolic style of the C-style languages?

Ever yearned of those times of verbose programming languages, where they were
compiled into native code?

Fret not friend, ShakeCpeare is here for your need.

Plug that silly "shakecpeare.h" into your includes, then write silly things like:

```c
#include "shakecpeare.h"

the status main function is an action with the body
that is this program
there is that individual that is a man
known as "Jack" by some
print that man line at once
the program should end now
```

And enjoy the native speed of your CPU while staying silly!

You don't think ShakeCpeare can handle anything more complex?

Haha! Try to compile the "shakecpeare.c" that's in this repo then,
it is not that complex but complex enough to prove that ShakeCpeare is
superior to plain C.

## Showcase

ShakeCpeare has:

Conditionals!
```c
if <condition> then
    ...
elseif <condition> then
    ...
otherwise
    ...
end
```

Loops!
```c
while <condition> begin
    ...
end

loop begin
    ...
end

where <loop variable>
also <condition>
at finale <post loop operation>
then
    ...
end
```

and Switch!
```c
switch <this> then
    when <case> execute
        ...
    default execute
        ...
end
```

With a bunch of meaningless thing to spice it up!

You can beg to the program!
```c
call printf that takes "Hello World\n"
calculate that please
```

Or you can command it!
```c
call printf that takes "Hello World\n"
calculate that at once
```

And many more silly little things!
